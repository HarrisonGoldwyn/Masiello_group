# Masiello_group
This repository contains program packages that are often used by the Masiello group members. 

All src* program packages are written in FORTRAN while tDDA is a in-house program package written in C.

Most packages are based on the DDSCAT 7.1 source code, https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/DDSCAT.7.1.html. Note that this version is no longer supported the DDSCAT team, however, a copy of it can be found in "srcPW". For details about DDSCAT 7.1, please see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1505.pdf and the following reference:
