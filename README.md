# Masiello_group
This repository contains program packages that are often used by the Masiello group members. 

All "src*" program packages are written in Fortran, "tDDA*" are in-house program packages written in C, and "MNPBEM17" is a toolbox 
written in MATALB.

Toolbox "MNPBEM", http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/#2, is developed by F. J. Garcia de Abajo and A. Howie,  Phys. Rev. B 65, 115418 (2002), for the simulation of metallic nanoparticles (MNP) using a boundary element method (BEM) approach. The 2017 version can be downloaded at http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/download.php. To respect the authors, we only put a "README" file in the "MNPBEM17" folder, in which you can find the instruction to download it.

Program packages "srcEELS", "srcPW_background", "srcPW_background_psf", and "srcPW_tDDAb" are the modified versions of the DDSCAT 7.1 from https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/DDSCAT.7.1.html. Note that the 7.1 version is no longer supported by the DDSCAT team, however, details about it can be found at  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1505.pdf and the following reference:
