# Masiello_group
This repository contains program packages that are often used by the Masiello group members. 

All src* program packages are written in FORTRAN while tDDA is a in-house program package written in C.

Program packages "srcEELS", "srcPW_background", "srcPW_background_psf", and "srcPW_tDDAb" are the modified versions of the DDSCAT 7.1 from https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/DDSCAT.7.1.html. Note that the 7.1 version is no longer supported the DDSCAT team, however, a copy of it can be found in "srcPW". For details about DDSCAT 7.1, please see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.1505.pdf and the following reference:
